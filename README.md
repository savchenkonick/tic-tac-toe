## About
The algorithm that implements this is called minimax. It's a brute force algorithm that maximizes the value of the AI's position and minimizes the worth of its opponent's.
It calculates all possible moves that might be played during the game, and choose the best one based on the assumption that its opponent will also play perfectly. So, it doesn't rely on the mistakes of its opponent and plays the game without fault from start to finish regardless of the opponent's skill!

## Technologies Used
- Python v3.6 or more
